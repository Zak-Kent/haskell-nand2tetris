# Nand2Tetris: assembler -> stack based VM -> compiler

This repo is a collection of the work done for projects 6 - 11
in the nand2tetris course.

A brief description of each project:
  - 6: Created an assembler for the Hack platform which translates symbolic Hack
       assembly into binary machine instructions for the Hack CPU.
  - 7 & 8: Created a VM translator which takes commands that run on a stack
           based VM and compiles those commands to symbolic Hack assembly.
  - 10 & 11: Built a Jack compiler which takes the higher level Jack language
             and generates VM commands.
